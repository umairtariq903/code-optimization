Hi , I have refactored the BookingRepositery file which has all the buisness logic.
I have tried to show that we can apply few basic things to refactor code which are reusability of code, less and clean code.
The file was huge , I have made small but effective changes and only on few portions. As refactoring whole file will take a lot of time.

I have written two basic test cases just to show case that i have experience with test cases. 

I hope these small changes can show case my skills.
